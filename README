git webcommit

A tool to commit changed/new files from a directory straint from the browser.

Depends on as little as possible installed on the webserver:
- php 5.2+
- git v1.7.x (why the version ? it needs: git status --porcelain)
- diff
- wc (for stats)

All you need is a git repository on the server and to upload a single PHP-file to your webserver.

Authentication can be handle by the webserver or with a hash in the settings section of the PHP-file.
