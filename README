git webcommit

A tool to commit changed/new files from a directory on the webserver straight from the browser.

It is meant to NOT make changes to the files in directory, only append new history to the repository.

Depends on as little as possible installed on the webserver:
- php 5.2+
- git v1.7.x (why the version ? it needs: git status --porcelain)
- diff
- wc (for stats)

All you need is a git repository on the server and to upload a single PHP-file to your webserver.

Authentication can be handle by the webserver (htpasswd or similair) or with a hash in the settings section of the PHP-file.
