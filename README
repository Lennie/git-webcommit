git webcommit

A tool to commit changed/new files from a directory on the webserver straight from the browser.

It is meant to NOT make changes to the files in directory, only append new history to the repository.

Use cases:
People working together on a project in a shared directory on a server. Which could be a WordPress or Drupal website
where people want to keep track of changes in templates and plugins or people uploading documents to a webdav-share.

Installation/setup:
All you need is a git repository on the server, change some settings at the top and upload the single PHP-file to your webserver.

Depends on as little as possible installed on the webserver:
- git v1.7.x (why that version ? it needs: git status --porcelain)
- php 5.2+
- diff
- wc (for stats)

Authentication can be handle by the webserver (htpasswd) or with a hash in the settings section of the PHP-file.

Missing, but planned features:
- diff stats: number of lines added/removed
- git commit stats
- listing .gitignore
- editing .gitignore
- ondemand diffs
